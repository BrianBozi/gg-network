# *GG-Network* 👾


Ready up! GG is a social networking app where gamers can post epic gaming moments, news, posts, etc.. This a space just for gaming and gaming related themes. Simply put *a web application for gamers who want to connect to other gamers*.


## Why?
Gaming has always been part of my life and played (no pun intended)  a humongous role in it. While there are other social networks, I realized that many of them have become very crowded with influencers and ads. This gave me the idea of creating a social network for me and my friends where we wouldnt get bombarded with a bunch of random distractions.
